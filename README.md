## Assignment 1

Make the car run a track by programming the commands for movement and calling them in the right order.

They key S is bound to stopping the car.

The key C is bound to "running the course".

Inside the file car.js edit the function runCourse() to complete the course.

In order for this function to work you must also edit all the commands for the car (except stop() which is already defined).

## Assignment 2

Create event based steering using arrow keys and steer the car.

In app.js there are keys that capture the arrow keys. Add function calls for the car object to the correct command.

### Assignment 3 (advanced)

Can you improve the smoothness of the steering? Examples:

* Make it possible to run at multiple speeds
* Make it turn by different amounts
* Ramp up speed smoothly
